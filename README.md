# Coffee-Machine
A very simple coffee machine with APIs for dispensing beverage, refilling on low items.
Since we dont need to scale out I have not added any object oriented-ness to the code to keep it simple and function oriented.

note: Python JSON reports error for extra comma in a JSON file at the end of the list

## Testing
Run the tester with command 'python Tester.py'
I have run it on python 3.8 but should work fine on python 2.x

## User Interface
It also has a user interface accessible via 'python Coffe.py' after uncommenting the last 2 lines in Coffee.py, It presents the user a simple menu to dispense a specific beverage or refill on items
